        <p>Elevator Pitch</p>
        <p>Hi, my name is Alan and it’s a pleasure to meet you. I’ll be graduating next year with my bachelor’s in information science from University of Arkansas at Little Rock. I discovered that I’m really interested in networking and network security. I’ve taken several classes related to this area and I feel like it’s a great fit for me. I’m looking for an entry level position where I can apply what I’ve learned and contribute to the success of the organization. Before attending UALR, I served over 30 years with the US Marine Corps and retired in July 2016 at the rank of Chief Warrant Officer 3. While serving in the USMC part of my job responsibilities were to ensure our equipment was able to communicate with each other, the external backup HDD and that our network was secure from outside threats. This past experience has been instrumental in my success at UALR.

            <p>Dear Sir,

I am seeking a position within your company. At your convenience, I'd appreciate the opportunity to discuss opportunities and my candidacy with you. You can find my resume attached.

In my 30+ years as an U.S. Marine, I have designed, developed, and managed our internal IT projects resulting in hardware, software, and network solutions that were cost effective, on time, and within the approved budget. I also have worked both as a manager and an analyst to develop information technology solutions for Combat Camera’s Deployed and Non-Deployed equipment.

In addition to development, many of my projects required me to be responsible for important high-level functions, including:

•	Development of Unit’s Command multiyear strategic information technology (IT) plans.

•	Working with Unit’s Command to develop written project specifications and detailed designs.

•	Management of project schedules and staffing plans, including consultants, internal customer resources, and outside vendors.

•	Specification and procurement of IT hardware, software, and network solutions.

•	Delivering presentations, interacting and managing project team members of various disciplines.

I have completed a B.S. in Information Science and current in software development and network skills and am proficient in Windows Server, MS SQL Server 2008, C++, Visual Studio 2005/2008, Word, Access, Excel, JavaScript, PHP, and HTML5/CSS. 

I believe that I have the broad range of experience, skills, IT knowledge, personal commitment, and professional track record to manage projects and personnel to help you meet your goals. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss with you how I can assist your company. Feel free to contact me anytime at (214) 679-8713. I will be available at your convenience.
