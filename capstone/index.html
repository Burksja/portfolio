			<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
			<p>For the past several years our company has been maintaining customer records utilizing the traditional paper and file cabinet. This has caused the company to misplace, lose and forget to add services rendered. The Young Electric Database (YED) project has been created to address and correct these issues and prevent further loss associated with the current record keeping practices.</p>
			<blockquote>&ldquo;The project will integrate a database solution with the customers current website in order to establish a reliable database infrastructure.&rdquo;</blockquote>
            
            <p><center><a href="#TOP">Top of Page</a></center></p>
