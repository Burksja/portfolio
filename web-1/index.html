        <h2>My Assessment</h2>
          <p>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity. Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data.</p>
          <assessment_grey>
          <p>This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplification usually does.</p>
          </assessment_grey>
          <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.</p>

    <questions>
      <h3>Questions</h3>
        <p>Please answer the following questions below. Remember to markup the information properly using HTML</p>

      <h4>Explain the difference between the "alt" attribute and the "title" attribute.</h4>
        <p>The "alt" attribute displays when an image does not load and describes what the image is, where as the "title" attribute displays on mouse-over and is just the title of the image.</p>

      <h4>Please provide an example of how to mark up a definition from the dictionary below</h4>
        <p>The HTML Definition element <img src="assets/images/dfn.png" alt="dfn_png"> is used to indicate the term being defined within the context of a definition phrase or sentence.</p>

      <h4>Provide an example of link pointing to your favorite site</h4>
